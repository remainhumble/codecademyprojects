    <td>#iamanid</td>

    <td>Type Selectors</td>
    <td>p</td>
    <td>CSS type selectors are used to match all elements of a given type or tag name. Unlike for HTML syntax, we do not include the angle brackets when using type selectors for tag names. When using type selectors, elements are matched regardless of their nesting level in the HTML. For instance, a type selector <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> Selects all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tags.

  <tr>
    <td>Descendant selector</td>
    <td>div p</td>

    <td>In CSS, a declaration is the key-value pair of a CSS property and its value. CSS declarations are used to set style properties and construct rules to apply to individual or groups of elements. The property name and value are separated by a colon, and the entire declaration must be terminated by a semi-colon.</td>

   <tr>
      <td>Font Size</td>

However, generally it is good to avoid using !important as bad practice.</td>
